# Temporal-LM
Pretrained language models use a vocabulary to translate words into numbers. However, these numbers do not reflect the relationship between words before being fed into deep learning models.
This point is important because years mentioned in texts have no difference from other words, leadning to the ignorance of continuous temporal trend. To be specific, when one article mentions
discrete numerical values 
We want to replace year by a soecial encoding schema
